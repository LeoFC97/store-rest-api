## Database

I chose to use a non-relational database, in my opinion its better to work with collections instead of tables in this situations.

For hosting database i chose mongoDbAtlas, because it have a free tier that can be hosted on AWS, Google Cloud or Azure. I chose Google Cloud beacuse its the only one that was SouthAmerica (SÃ£o Paulo) as a region on the free tier.

## Running the Unity tests

There are Unity Tests on the project in order to ensure that it runs cohesively, and they can be found at their respective folders.
The tests cover subjects such as string sanitazing and sorting methods. The tests in place are there to make sure the code isn't broken while the API was being developed - it is essential for present and future maintenance.

```
npm run test
```

## Running local

To run the project local at your machine you need a .evn file, following the example on .env.example. Then, just run the following commands:

To install:

```

To run:

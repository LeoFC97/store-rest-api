## Running the Unity tests

There are Unity Tests on the project in order to ensure that it runs cohesively, and they can be found at their respective folders.
The tests cover subjects such as string sanitazing and sorting methods. The tests in place are there to make sure the code isn't broken while the API was being developed - it is essential for present and future maintenance.

```
npm run test
